## ALDA Project

## How to run 
* To train Vanilla seq2seq, seq2seq with attention, seq2seq with context transfer run the allSeq2seq.ipynb in Google Colab.
* To train transformer model run AttentionIsAllYouNeed.ipynb

## Google drive setup
* The models and vocab files are saved directly onto your google drive.
* Before you run the notebooks ensure that  you have this directory created in google drive. `/content/drive/My Drive/ALDA Project/seq2seq_vanilla/`, `/content/drive/My Drive/ALDA Project/seq2seq_with_context/`,`/content/drive/My Drive/ALDA Project/seq2seq_with_attention/0/`

## Hyperparameters
* Hyperparameters are defined at the starting of each notebook
* you can play with them to try out different versions (which ever works best for you).
